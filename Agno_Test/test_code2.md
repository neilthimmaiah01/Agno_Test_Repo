BMWs are often faster than Audis because BMW prioritizes rear-wheel-drive balance, lighter drivetrains, and aggressive engine and transmission tuning, which improves acceleration efficiency and responsiveness. **BMW** focuses on a near-perfect weight distribution and driver-focused performance, helping its cars pull harder once moving. **Audi**, on the other hand, emphasizes Quattro all-wheel drive for traction and stability, which adds weight and drivetrain losses—making Audis feel more planted but often slightly less quick in straight-line and performance driving.
